            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p> Hello, my name is Jordan Riendeau. I am a student at the University of Rhode Island. A fun fact about me is that I play football here at URI. I am from Narragansett, Rhode Island, and have lived in Rhode Island my whole life. I have a sister and brother and thats about it for me.</p>
            <h3> Sports</h3>
            <p> Sports are actually what gave me my best skills in life so far, like teamwork, leadership, probelm solving, and more. Although I play football at URI, it is not my favorite sport. My favorite sport is actually baseball. I had the opportunity to play in colllege, but I turned it down because I wanted to try something new and challenging, so I tool my opportunity to play football.</p>
